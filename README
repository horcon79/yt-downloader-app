## Transcoding and Compression

To reduce file size:

2. Enter lower video bitrate:
   - 3000-5000 kbps - high quality
   - 1500-2000 kbps - medium quality (recommended)
   - 500-1000 kbps - low quality
3. Set audio bitrate (default 192 kbps)

## Troubleshooting

### Video without sound or picture

Ensure `ffmpeg.exe` is in the `tools/` folder. FFmpeg is required to merge video and audio streams.

### Format cannot be selected

Check logs at the bottom of the window. Ensure all tools are available.

### Error "yt-dlp.exe not found"

Copy `yt-dlp.exe` to the `tools/` folder next to the application EXE.
